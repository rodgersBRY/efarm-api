This README provides clear instructions for setting up the boilerplate, running the server, and understanding its structure and features.

# Node.js API Boilerplate

A simple and scalable boilerplate for building RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This boilerplate includes user handlers with predefined routes, controllers, and a model for efficient API development.

---

## Features

- **Express Framework**: Lightweight and fast web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Database connection and sample User model provided.
- **Modular Structure**: Well-organized code for easy scalability.
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration through `.env` files.
- **User Handlers**: Includes user-related routes and controllers.

---

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the server.

---

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud instance)

---

### Installation

- **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd node-api-boilerplate
   npm install

### Configuration
- **Create a .env File**:
In the project root directory, create a .env file:
    ```bash
    touch .env

•	In the terminal, copy the contents of env.copy to .env:
    ```bash
    cp .env.copy .env

### Access API
- **Access the API**:
The server will start at http://localhost:4000.

Example endpoints:

	•	POST /api/v1/users/login - login a user.
	•	POST /api/users/register - Create a new user.
    •	GET /api/users/users - Get users registered.

### Highlights

User Handlers:

	•	Predefined routes, controllers, and models for user operations.
	•	Includes examples for fetching and creating users.
